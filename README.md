# Archive Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a structured directory, populate it with files, archive the directories, and compress the archive. It also covers how to extract and verify the contents of the archive.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Up the Project Directory Structure

Create a Main Project Directory:**

mkdir ArchiveProject
cd ArchiveProject

### 2. Set Up the Project Directory Structure

Create the following subdirectories within the ArchiveProject directory:
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3

This command creates three subdirectories: dir1, dir2, and dir3, which will be used to store the sample files.
